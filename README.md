# Car Price Prediction Web App:

### Introduction:
The Car Price Prediction Web App is a project that involves creating a web application to predict car prices based on various factors like 'car name,' 'fuel type,' 'number of previous owners,' 'distance traveled by the car,' 'car age,' and 'present price of the car.'

### Why (Need)? Problem in Real Time:
The need for car price prediction arises from the dynamic nature of the automotive market. Traditional pricing methods may not always reflect real-time market conditions, leading to inefficiencies in pricing and potentially impacting buying and selling decisions.

### Real-Time Use of This Web App:
1) It helps both customers and sellers to determine the current price of a car based on specific requirements.
2) It is useful for manufacturers in making business decisions by analyzing correlations between the price and each feature of the car.
 - Let's consider a scenario where there's a second-hand car showroom, and a customer arrives to buy a car. The customer provides their requirements (all the features of the car), and we enter these requirements into the web app. The app then predicts the expected price of the car based on the customer's requirements, providing a quick and efficient way to determine the price.

### Working Flow:
 - Collecting Dataset: Gather a comprehensive dataset containing information about various cars, including their features.
 - Preprocessing Data: Utilize tools for cleaning and preprocessing data, such as Pandas and scikit-learn.
 - Model Selection: Choose a machine learning model that fits the problem, such as linear regression, decision trees, or the Random Forest algorithm.
 - Evaluation Metrics: Define metrics for evaluating the model's performance.
 - Web Interface: Create a user interface using platforms like Streamlit.
